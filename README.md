# Recipe App

## Introduction
This app is a result of following a tutorial from digitalocean.com. Credits to the
author [Chuks Opia](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/troy34) and editor [Timothy Nolan](digitalocean.com/community/users/tnolan).

## Outcome
This tutorial teaches the interaction between React and Rails, as well as basic `CRUD` (`U` is left as exercise for the reader as per `comment_83195`.

[5/1/2020] There seems to be a bug, when viewing all recipes, clicking back shows an empty page. Following `comment_91406`, one solution was to use `turbolink`. The fix is also applied (can be found in `app/javascript/packs/Index.jsx`)
